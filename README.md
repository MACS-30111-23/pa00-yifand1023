* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)
